# Creating a macOS app bundle

This directory contains shell script which will create, sign and package a macOS app bundle in this directory.
For it to work, however, a static installation of wxWidgets must be installed on your system.

Also, I cannot assure you that the scripts will work flawlessly on your machine, its primary use is for me to bundle
the application for new releases.
